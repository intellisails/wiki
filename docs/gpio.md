## RS485
The RS485 bus transmission protocol, as a serial bus communication protocol standard, adopts a unique structural design of balanced transmission and differential reception, endowing it with excellent common mode interference suppression capability.

- RS-485 transceiver that meets the requirements of TIA/EIA-485 standard. 
- Maximum transmission rate of 12Mbps

## Alarm In
Active contacts (live signal contacts) provide a certain voltage or current, and the signal level is determined by their internal circuit.

- Two-way Wet Contact
- Supports DC 3~5V potential, 5mA current

## Alarm out
Passive contact (no voltage contact), it does not provide any voltage or current on its own, it is just a physical switch. Its state (open or closed) is determined by external circuits.

- Two-way Dry Contact
- Maximum switching voltage: 250VAC and 220VDC
- Maximum Switching Current: 2A current
- Maximum switching power: 60W
